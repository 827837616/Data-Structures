# Data-Structures

These are some of the projects I did while taking Data Structures (CS 112) my first semester. All projects are completed in Java.

Short explanations of each project:
1. Big Integer
    * A command line interface program to parse, add, subtract, and multiply integers larger than can be stored in the `int` datatype.
    * BigTest and DigitNode classes had been provided.
2. Trie
    * A command line program to take words in a text file and generate a prefix-trie
    * Also implemented trie-search to search for words fulfilling a prefix in the trie
    * TrieApp and TrieNode classes had been provided.
3. Little Search Engine
    * A command line program to take text from text file(s) and generate searcheable hashtables representing a "word index"
    * Indexes words based on document and number of occurrences so that user can search in which documents words appear with the highest frequency in the set of documents. 
    * Occurrence class and makeIndex method had been provided.
4. Friends
    * A command line program to take a text file with data formatted to described person relationships and create a graph
    * Graph also allows for searching of:
      * "cliques" or islands of friends
      * Shortest chain between two people
       * "Connectors" –– individuals who, when removed from the graph, cause other individuals to be separated entirely from another side of the graph
    * Apart from the Friends class, driver and node code was provided
       
Notes:
  * I did not include the second project, Expression Evaluation for evaluating arbitrarily nested mathematical expressions, because the code is a mess.
